        "While working in QGIS with the manipulation of raster layers, the step in question was the need to get the slope of such layers (assuming they have already been properly reprojected into an crs that treats the data preferably in meters), group and characterize them, and finally get the total area based on these pre-defined groups. Only the process of getting the total area will be done in this notebook.<br>\n",
        "For the firsts steps of this job, the QGIS toolbox provides us a tool called Raster Layer Unique Value Report, which has as output a html file. This html file has a \"table\" of three columns:\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "*   value: pixel value\n",
        "*   count: count of pixels with this value\n",
        "*   m2: total area in square meters of pixels with this value.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "With this file saved, you can import it into your python environment in the way that suits you. Since this work was done in Google Colab, the chosen method was \"gdown\". The process that takes places is the conversion of the html file into a csv one, where the columns of the html \"table\" shall be the columns of the final csv file.<br>\n",
        "Thereby, we will finally obtain the complete result. For this, we may use those pre-estabilished groups as the parameter for defining sum intervals. In this notebook we'll use as example the slope intervals of 0-3%, 3-6% and 6-12%.<br>\n",
